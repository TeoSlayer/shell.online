# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes are recorded here. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.9] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Add a source-building Homebrew formula directly to this repository. Brew fetches the tagged source and Go build dependency, compiles locally, and installs the result; after one-time tap trust, install, upgrade, or uninstall with the short `shell-online` formula name.
- Add real phone-form-factor Codex captures and clear Homebrew, standalone installer, and build-it-yourself paths to the landing page.

### Changed

- Harden the no-Homebrew installer with Rosetta detection, writable-path validation, actionable download and checksum errors, safer shell-profile guidance, and warnings when an older `shell` executable shadows the new installation.
- Track Homebrew command copies separately while preserving the existing privacy-limited analytics and stored statistics.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-08-22

### Security

- Build all release binaries with Go 1.27.0, eliminating standard-library vulnerabilities present in the previous toolchain.
- Add automated dependency auditing, govulncheck, CodeQL, secret scanning guidance, and least-privilege pinned CI actions.
- Document the bearer-link trust model and private vulnerability-reporting process.

### Added

- Publish deterministic SHA-256 manifests and machine-readable release metadata for every supported binary.
- Show the release version and checksum manifest from the landing page and terminal controls.
- Verify and print the selected binary's digest during installation.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-08-22

- Reject stale private background flags with a parent-bound startup handshake.
- Support safe Claude Code conversation handoffs through a forked process.
